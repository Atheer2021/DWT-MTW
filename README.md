# Watermark Embedding and Extraction using Mobius Transform and Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This project demonstrates embedding and extracting watermarks in images using Mobius Transform applied to Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficients. The parameters of the Mobius Transform are optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to maximize watermark fidelity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
- scikit-image (`scikit-image`)
- PyWavelets (`pywavelets`)
- DEAP (`deap`)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image pywavelets deap
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to embed and extract watermarks using Mobius Transform and GA optimization.
- `lena.png`: Sample image for watermarking.
- `logo1.png`: Sample watermark image.

## Usage

1. **Embedding Watermark**:
   - Modify `main.py` to specify the paths to your original image (`lena.png`) and watermark (`logo1.png`).
   - Run `main.py`. It will embed the watermark using optimized Mobius Transform parameters and display the watermarked image.

2. **Extracting Watermark**:
   - After embedding, the script will extract the watermark and compute metrics (SSIM, PSNR, BER, NCC) to evaluate fidelity.
   - Extracted watermarks are saved as images (`extracted_watermark_{wavelet}_level_{level}_{watermark_name}.png`).

3. **Optimizing Mobius Transform Parameters**:
   - The script optimizes Mobius Transform parameters using a Genetic Algorithm (`optimize_mobius_parameters_DEAP` function). It aims to maximize SSIM between original and extracted watermarks.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The script provides visualizations of original image, watermarked image, and extracted watermark using Matplotlib.

## Functions

- `embed_watermark_dwt_mobius`: Embeds watermark into DWT coefficients using Mobius Transform.
- `extract_watermark_dwt_mobius`: Extracts watermark from watermarked image using Mobius Transform.
- `optimize_mobius_parameters_DEAP`: Optimizes Mobius Transform parameters using Genetic Algorithm (DEAP library).
- `calculate_ber`: Calculates Bit Error Rate (BER) between original and extracted watermarks.
- `calculate_ncc`: Calculates Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) between original and extracted watermarks.

## Outputs

- Watermarked image with embedded watermark.
- Extracted watermark image saved as `extracted_watermark_{wavelet}_level_{level}_{watermark_name}.png`.
- Console output with SSIM, PSNR, MSE, BER, and NCC metrics.

**Notes**:
- Ensure `lena.png` and `logo1.png` (or your chosen image names) are present in the same directory as `main.py`.
- Modify paths and parameters as needed for different images and watermark sizes.
- Include additional sections or details specific to your implementation or requirements.
